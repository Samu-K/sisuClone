# Instructions for development

## Style guide

 All developers should use Checkstyle as their linter. Make sure that Checkstyle is set to [google_checks](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/google_style.html).

## Development workflow

 **Nothing is pushed to main, ever!**

 Instead for each new feature always create an issue, then create a new branch and merge request relating to that issue.

 Make you changes to the new branch. When done ask someone to look over your code and merge it.
